Completed Features

- Task manager site that allows the user to post new tasks to a mongo database and update the DOM with the list of tasks immediately.

[x] - Create a front end that allows a user to enter a task.

    - [x] Task properties: {task: string, category: string, description: string, notes: string, date: string, complete: boolean}

    - [x] Each task should have a "complete task" checkbox and "delete task" button

[x] - Set up the server and connect it to Mongo using mongoose.

[x] - Create a schema in a router to send task data to the Mongo database.

[x] - Use angular models to create an object from the inputs to POST to the router on the server and the Mongo database collection.

[x] - Once a task is added to the database, the front end should make a GET request to the database in order to to display the array of objects from the server.

[x] - a PUT request that changes the tasks "complete" property should be written for the complete task checkbox, and the DOM should change to reflect this change

[x] - a DELETE request that splices the object from the array on the database and updates the DOM should be written

[x] - CSS styling to finish it off

[x] - Implement Bootstrap to take the visuals of the page up a notch.

[x] - Move the inputs into a form and use ng-submit so that the user can hit enter to add a new task.

[x] - In whatever fashion you would like, create an 'are you sure: yes / no' option when deleting a task. Once again, you can interpret this however you would like.

[x] - Add front-end validation to the 'make-a-task' form.

Next Steps

[] - Add a category field for the task. Allow users to filter by task category.

[] - Adjust the logic so that completed tasks are brought to the bottom of the page, where the remaining tasks left to complete are brought to the top of the list.
