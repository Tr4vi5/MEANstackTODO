Next Steps

[x] - Create a front end that allows a user to enter a task.

    - [x] Task properties: {task: string, category: string, description: string, notes: string, date: string, complete: boolean}

    - [x] Each task should have a "complete task" checkbox and "delete task" button

[x] - Set up the server and connect it to Mongo using mongoose.

[x] - Create a schema in a router to send task data to the Mongo database.

[x] - Use angular models to create an object from the inputs to POST to the router on the server and the Mongo database collection.

[x] - Once a task is added to the database, the front end should make a GET request to the database in order to to display the array of objects from the server.

[x] - a PUT request that changes the tasks "complete" property should be written for the complete task checkbox, and the DOM should change to reflect this change

[x] - a DELETE request that splices the object from the array on the database and updates the DOM should be written

[] - CSS styling to finish it off
